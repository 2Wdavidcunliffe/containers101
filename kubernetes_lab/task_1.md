## Learning your tools
Being an Orchestrator of containers, there are various tools that you will use to manage Kubernetes. The most basic one is Kubectl (pronounced Cube-Cuddle or Cube-Control...[yes this is a religious argument](https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/5qthoc/how_should_i_pronounce_kubectl/))
Our good friends at both Google and Docker have made life easier and included it in their SDK's now as well.

   ```kubectl controls the Kubernetes cluster manager.
