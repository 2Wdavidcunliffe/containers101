<h2 id="inspecting-images">Inspecting Images</h2>
<p>As mentioned, one of the beauties of containers is that you can layer on your ideas atop others existing work so you don’t have to reinvent the wheel… But, anyone can push images to publicly available via repositories like Docker Hub and <a href="http://Quay.io">Quay.io</a> or Google’s GCR, so how do we know what’s in them? Should we just trust the creator or take a look to see how it was made?</p>
<p>There are several things you can look at before taking a leap and trusting a public image for your project.</p>
<pre><code>docker search nodejs
