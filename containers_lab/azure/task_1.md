## Search for Images
One of the beauties of containers is that you can layer on your ideas atop others existing work so you don't have to reinvent the wheel.

Let's have a look at the default Docker Hub repository and find an image to build on

 1. Execute the command:    **`docker search nodejs`** 
![docker search nodejs](https://github.com/Burwood/containers101/raw/azure/containers_lab/images/Azure_docker_search_posh.png)
 2. Now execute the command: **`docker search node`**
![docker search nodejs](https://github.com/Burwood/containers101/raw/azure/containers_lab/images/Azure_docker_search_posh2.png)

Notice the difference? It pays to think about how you search for something. You can also use the Web UI at https://hub.docker.com to search and filter on certified or official images
